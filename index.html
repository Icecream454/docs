    <h1>Privacy Policy and Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><strong>App Name:</strong> Draw</p>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> Feb 14, 2026</p>

    <p>This document explains how the <strong>Draw</strong> app handles user data and the rules for our reward-based entertainment service. By using the app, you agree to these terms.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Email Address:</strong> Collected via social login (Google) to manage your account and synchronize earned reward points (Units).</li>
        <li><strong>Device Identifiers:</strong> Collected for analytics, crash reporting, and preventing multiple account abuse or fraudulent activities.</li>
        <li><strong>Activity Data:</strong> We track in-app engagement to ensure rewards are distributed fairly based on legitimate user participation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Reward System & Gift Card Policy</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>In-App Units:</strong> Users can earn virtual points ("Units") through legitimate in-app activities. These Units are promotional in nature.</li>
        <li><strong>Reward Redemption:</strong> Units may be redeemed for digital rewards, such as <strong>Amazon Gift Cards or Google Play Gift Cards</strong>, subject to availability and our verification process.</li>
        <li><strong>No Real Money Gambling:</strong> Draw is NOT a gambling app. There is no opportunity to wager real money or win prizes based on chance or betting. All rewards are earned solely through task-based participation.</li>
        <li><strong>No Purchase Necessary:</strong> Participation in any drawing or reward activity within the Draw app is completely free. No monetary payment, deposit, or in-app purchase is required to enter or win. Entries are earned solely through legitimate in-app engagement and activity.</li>
        <li><strong>Skill and Engagement Based:</strong> Our reward system is not a game of chance based on wagering. It is an engagement-based reward platform designed to recognize and compensate users for their consistent participation and accumulated activity points within the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Promotional Drawing:</strong> All ball-matching simulations (5 White balls, 1 Powerball) are defined as promotional events intended for entertainment purposes only. This serves as a transparent and fair method for distributing rewards to our active users as part of a marketing promotion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. User Data Protection</h2>
    <p>We use HTTPS encryption for all data transmissions. Your information is retained only as long as necessary to provide our services or until you request account deletion.</p>

    <h2>4. Account Deletion and Rights</h2>
    <p>You may request account and data deletion at any time via the app settings or by contacting our support email.</p>
